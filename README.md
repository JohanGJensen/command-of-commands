## The concept
Have you ever had to navigate a lot of different repositories and run a lot of different package.json script commands to install and spin of different applications? Rather than concatenate and print (cat) or enter your code editor of choice, this small application lists out available options for you and lets you select a command to run.

This is a very simple cobra based CLI application written in GOLANG.
